INSTALLING

  Put imv.exe somewhere on your path.

  If you prefer to use a stripped-down version and you're sure you
  have GDI+, use imv_light.exe, which is less than 2/3rds the size
  of imv.exe.


LAUNCHING

  Run on the commandline as:

     imv [imagefile]

  You can use 'open with' and it will do the right thing. You can
  even set it as the default for JPG/PNG/BMP filetypes, but since
  it can't open certain ones, this may not be a good idea.


USER INTERFACE

  Press F1 while running imv for documentation.


UNINSTALLING

  Delete the executable.
