INSTALLING

  Put it somewhere on your path.


LAUNCHING

  Run on the commandline as:
     imv [imagefile]

  You can use 'open with' and it will do the right thing. You can
  even set it as the default for JPG/PNG/BMP filetypes, but since
  it can't open certain ones, this may not be a good idea.


USER INTERFACE

  Press F1 while running imv for documentation.


UNINSTALLING

  Delete the executable.
